## Introduction

PyCamp is a hands-on workshop designed to introduce participants to Python and essential Data Science libraries. Throughout this workshop, we cover topics such as Python basics, data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, web development with Flask and Django, and machine learning with TensorFlow.

## Installation

To get started, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Pycamp.git
    cd Pycamp
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Workshop Content

This repository includes code and examples for the following topics:

- Python Basics
- Data Manipulation with Pandas

Feel free to explore the directories to access the specific content related to each topic.

## How to Use the Code

Each topic has its dedicated folder containing code examples and exercises. Follow the instructions provided in each directory to understand and run the code. You can also use the code as a reference for your projects or further exploration.

## Dependencies

The workshop code relies on the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Make sure to install these dependencies in your virtual environment as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
